### Pula

Outlook Festival is a massive bass music festival started in 2008. It continues 4 days - with number of boat parties and more than 10 stages in Fort Punta Christo, Pula, Croatia. Artists come from all over the world, including Drum&Bass, Dubstep, HipHop scene in Europe. In the mid 2013 all line up has been announced and as soon as I saw the name of LTJ Bukem, I booked a ticket.

Flight took more than 24 hours including transit at Frankfurt. During the week of the festival, this small Pula airport accepts 15 thousands attendees and 100+ artists.

Pula is an old town and has some historical places. Calm, nice weather and good seafood.

Festival starts afternoon with boat parties, but I didn't join it because it's tough to stay there from noon til the next morning. So I stayed at guest house until late afternoon and had short tour around Pula each day. This is a church called Sveta Eufemija in a town called Rovinj where located north of Pula.

### Outlook Festival

Full of people, dancing, screaming, drinking, laughing, camping, peeing etc. Sounds massive with crazy amount of bass.

Each stage is placed very far and took 10-15 min to move between stage to stage.

Look at this timetable. Crazy amount of artists. It turns out that Bukem will play at the final day which is the day I was going to take off to Hvar island. Need to make a decision either discard my current air ticket and book a new one, or miss Bukem.

I took a taxi and found this. Yes.

### AirBnb

I chose AirBnb to stay and that was a great experience. Staying at local area with local people is completely different experience from staying at hotels. The house I stayed is beautiful, simple and clean with olive tree. There's a private yacht harbor near the house and the area is very quiet.

The AirBnb owner is a Croatian girl who came back from Prague to her parents house for summer vacation. Her mother kindly cooked me Croatian food, and they are amazingly good.

I came here to listen to him. The final act of the final day at the main stage of Outlook Festival 2013. I was standing by in the most front, center of the floor. He started with [Pulsaar - Good Times (Vandera Remix)](https://www.facebook.com/vanderadub/posts/10151548464141886). I've never felt this amount of bass before. I was sure that I made a right decision. I wish Conrad could be here...

I had great 4 days with hospitality from her and her family. Her dad kindly took me to the bus terminal so that I can take an early morning bus to the airport.

Due to the plan change, I had to go to Zagreb, which is a capital city of Croatia, then take a flight to Split, take a bus again to the port and take a ferry to Hvar island. Zagreb looked very different from Pula - I only took a look from the bus, but in my impression it looks very similar to Russia while Pula is similar to Italy.

This is a small airplane from Zagreb to Split. Story continues to my next destination, [Hvar](/photo/hvar-2013/).
