## The Cathedral

Before getting back to Japan, I visited Köln, only 1 hour by train from Frankfurt am Main. When I got out from Köln Hauptbahnhof (Cologne main station), what I saw blowed my mind and I couldn't move for a while.

It's HUGE. GR's 28mm equivalent focal length was not enough to capture its entire silhouette. 157 meters height is close to 40 stories building, and building of the Cologne Cathedral took 632 years.

Gerhard Richter's stained glass, which was one of the reason for me to visit Colonge.

Unfortuantely Museum Ludwig was closed, so I just walk around the town for the rest of the time, and get back to Frankfurt.
