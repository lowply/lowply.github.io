## Foodstuffs

I arrived at Hvar island late afternoon. The owner of guest house came to the port with her husband and their baby girl to pick me up.

They already had 3 more people and as soon as I arrived, they served us a dinner. All fish, cheese and vegetables are produced in this island.

And of course this olive oil. The owner's husband is a olive oil farmer and was awarded the best olive oil contest in Criatia.

On the next morning we had the best breakfast ever - Tomato, egg, bread, ham, cheese, honey and coffee. And this plum. I want to visit this guest house just for this breakfast!
