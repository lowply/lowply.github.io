Hi, I'm [@lowply](https://twitter.com/lowply).

I work at [GitHub](https://github.com/lowply) as a Software Engineer. Prior to GitHub, [I was at one huge tech company for 3 years and one small startup for 5 years](https://read.cv/lowply). [I take some photos](https://instagram.com/lowply) with various cameras. [I try to write a photo journal](/photo) when traveling. [I used to play Drum & Bass](https://www.mixcloud.com/lowply) at night clubs as a Good Looking Records' unofficial advocate.

I'm based in Tokyo, Japan.
